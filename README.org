* Tree-promote

Promote and demote a tree for  quick and easy code manipulation. Think
org-mode, but for code.

Meant for indentation-based languages.

Warning: horrible and rough implementation, but yet super great !

Example:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
def foo(): # <- point on this line, call M-x tree-promote
    pass
print
#+END_SRC
you get
#+BEGIN_SRC python
    def foo():
        pass
print
#+END_SRC

** Usage

Evaluate the buffer and call
: M-x tree-promote

Shortcut put at =C-c >=.

Demote: =M-x tree-promote-demote=

Delete the tree:
: M-x tree-promote-delete

Comment it:
: M-x tree-promote-comment

Call the hydra to see all choices:
: M-x tree-promote-hydra

Incoming: select the indentation yourself (as does =M-x indent-rigidly=).


** Ideas, todos

[X] Demote.

[X] Indent according to mode. Done for python, yaml and jade.

[] Do something with the default  behaviour of =M-x indent-rigidly= which
lets us indent interactively. Would be useful for jade templates.

[] See if  the utilities functions  of mine  on [[https://gitlab.com/emacs-stuff/my-elisp/blob/master/yaml-utils.el][yaml-utils]] can  be useful
(indent all siblings at once ? Move around siblings ?).

See `move-text` in melpa to move regions up and down.
