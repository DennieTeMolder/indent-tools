* Tree-promote

Promote and demote a tree for  quick and easy code manipulation. Think
org-mode, but for code.

Meant for indentation-based languages. Quickly tested on python.

Warning: horrible and rough implementation !

** Usage

Evaluate the buffer and call
: M-x tree-promote

** Implementation

- let "beg" be the first point of the current line
- find the next line that starts with the same indentation
- let "end" be the first point of that sibling
- indent the region between "beg" and "end".

I took some utilities functions of mine on [[https://gitlab.com/emacs-stuff/my-elisp/blob/master/yaml-utils.el][yaml-utils]].

See `move-text` in melpa to move regions up and down.
